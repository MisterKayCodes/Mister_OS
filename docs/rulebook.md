Level-Up Dev Rulebook by MisterKay (2025 Edition) The consolidated, ultimate guide for moving from “writing code” to “architecting resilient systems.”

This rulebook is mandatory for all development, testing, and deployment phases.

Part 1: The Core Architecture (Stability & State)
Rule 1: The System is always in a known state The application must always know exactly what it is doing—whether idle, processing, waiting for confirmation, or resting. Unknown or undefined states are bugs waiting to happen.

Rule 2: Store all critical state in durable storage Never keep vital information only in temporary variables or RAM. Use a database, persistent files, or external caches so the state survives restarts, crashes, or updates.

Rule 3: Single responsibility per file Each file must do one job. No “mega-files” handling logic, database, API handlers, and helpers all at once. If you cannot summarize a file’s purpose in one sentence, it is too complex.

Rule 4: Logic must be explicit and readable Avoid vague or magical code.

Good example:

if missed_days >= 2: return RESET_TO_TODAY Bad example:

if x > 2: do_special_thing()

Rule 5: Idempotency (Same input, same result) The system must behave predictably. If the same command is received twice, the result should be the same as if it happened once.

Rule 6: No “smart” guessing The system must wait for explicit commands. It should never guess user intent.

Part 2: Resilience & Professionalism (Maintenance & Growth)
Rule 7: Expect failure, design for recovery Crashes, network timeouts, and database hiccups will happen. Design the system to handle partial completions and retries gracefully.

Rule 8: Boring code is good code Write code that is easy to read and maintain, even if it is slightly longer. Avoid clever one-liners and deep nesting.

Rule 9: Write automated tests for core logic Tests are your safety net. Cover state changes, business logic, and previous bug fixes with unit tests.

Rule 10: Observability (Logs + Metrics) Implement detailed logs with timestamps and context. Use metrics and “heartbeats” to monitor system health and catch downtime proactively.

Rule 11: Separate business logic from integrations Keep core rules (e.g., task management) separate from external APIs (Telegram, database).

Rule 12: Handle errors explicitly Never crash silently or use empty catch blocks. Use try/except blocks to log clear error messages and keep the system in a known state.

Part 3: The Senior Workflow (Deployment & Security)
Rule 13: Consistent style and pinned dependencies Follow a consistent naming and formatting style. Pin library versions to avoid unexpected breakage.

Rule 14: Security and Data Minimization Never log sensitive data. Validate and sanitize all user inputs. Only collect necessary data and delete what is no longer needed.

Rule 15: Clean Version Control Use Git properly with small, atomic commits and clear messages. Use branches for new features and merge only after testing.

Rule 16: The “Boy Scout” Rule Always leave code cleaner than you found it. Fix small violations to prevent technical debt.

Rule 17: Documentation is the “Why” Maintain documentation that explains architectural decisions and setup instructions.

Bonus Rule 18: The Safe Deployment Protocol When deploying updates or fixes:

Backup: Back up production data first. Staging: Test updates locally or in a dev environment, including running all tests. Graceful Stop: Stop the service safely on your server. Atomic Update: Pull code and update dependencies. Monitor: Restart and watch logs and metrics immediately for anomalies. Rollback Plan: Be ready to revert to the previous version instantly if things fail.

Summary
Junior devs focus on making it work. Senior devs focus on making it last. Following these rules turns code into a resilient, maintainable system.
